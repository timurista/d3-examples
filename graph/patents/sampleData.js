      "PURPOSE: A method for constructing artificial landscaping boulders used for rock-climbing in a complex, a landscape architecture, a park, a riverside, and a roadside is provided to form a natural rock with artificial stones and to plant trees and bryophyte, thereby making users feel like climbing a real natural rock. CONSTITUTION: A method for constructing artificial landscaping boulders used for rock-climbing in a complex, a landscape architecture, a park, a riverside, and a roadside is as follows. Silicon of a gel state is spread on a surface of a cleaned natural stone and hardened. A mortar paste is injected into the hardened silicon mold, and a metallic fixture is fixed by being fitted into the silicon mold. The silicon mold is separated from the stone when the mortar paste is hardened so that an artificial stone(10) is formed. Frames are joined to the front surface of a base wall(20) one after another so that a skeleton frame(30) is formed. The artificial stones are attached on the skeleton frame one after another so that an artificial stone wall is formed. A climbing route is formed by joining the artificial stones in which holders(13) are formed. Trees(40), moss(41), bryophyte are planted on the artificial stones. Concrete is charged in between the artificial stone wall and the base wall and cured so that the artificial stone wall and the base wall are fixed into a body by a concrete fill layer(50).",

When a climber climbs by stepping on one high-position boss and grasping the corresponding high-position suspending rods with hands, due to the gravity action of a human body, the sliding steel channel downwards moves along a square guide rail, a piston in a damping cylinder is compressed to discharge a working medium to enable the piston to generate resistance for working, a steel wire rope arranged on a fixed pulley draws a piston in an other-side damping cylinder to suck the working medium, and then the corresponding sliding steel channel is driven to rise along the square guide rail to reset. When the downwards-moving boss reaches the low position, the boss is limited by a stop block to stop moving. The climber climbs by stepping on the high-position boss on the other portion and grasping the corresponding high-position suspending rods again at the moment. The cycle repeats in this way, and the climber continuously climbs. Climbing is a high-energy-consumption aerobic exercise.

    title: "Rock climbing exercising machine",
    abstract:
      "The invention describes a sport exercising machine which can simulate a rock climbing wall. The concept of the rock climbing exercising machine is based on a vertical loop of rubber belt wrapped around a top and bottom pulley, such forming 2 vertical flat surfaces.  As the 2 pulleys rotate in the same direction, one of the vertical flat surface is travelling downwards, while the other travels upwards. The vertical flat surface that travels downwards is the face used for climbing and will be referred to as the front of the machine. Onto the belt, the climb holds are attached. The climb holds are the fixings used by the exercising person to ascend.  The top pulley is mechanically engaged to a servodrive that controls the travel of the belt, matching the ascending rate of the climber. As the exercising person is ascending on the belt, the servodrive allows the belt to descend, maintaining the climber at approximately the same height relative to the ground. To increase the difficulty of the climbing exercise, the machine is capable of tilting from vertical up to 10 degrees to simulate overhang. The frame of the rock climbing exercising machine is held in upright position by the main frame. The connection between the frame of the machine and the main frame is via a pair of ball bearings, located at the upper end, allowing the frame to swing from vertical to achieve the overhang. The frame is tilted from vertical by a pair of pneumatic cylinders connected between the rear of the main frame and the bottom of the frame of the exercising machine. The climbing holds are installed on horizontal rails attached to the belt. The climb holds can slide along the rail, allowing them to be rearranged to suit different levels of difficulty. As the climbing is exercised on an endless loop, the climber is not limited by the end of the wall, enabling her/him to continuously climb.",
