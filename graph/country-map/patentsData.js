In addition, most players are amateurs and usually play chess in the spare time in the evening with poor light, so it is very important to improve the visibility of the chess pieces so that the chess players can see clearly the chess pieces. A series of tests proves that the chess pieces can give out light in the evening and can be seen very clearly by coating black paint on the background of the chess pieces, red paint on the background of the chess pieces of the opponent, white paint on the convex characters and luminous fluorescent ink on the white paint and putting the chess pieces in the sunlight for a certain time in the daytime.",

Since the state-space of this game is much larger in the potential moves, an arbiter is used to validate possible moves that one player might choose to make. Using either a regular or modified chess board, the pieces on the board move backwards. Three such moves are described in the I-castle, spawn and I-check moves.

Particularly, a column of grids is added on each side of the 9 columns of grids, so the chess board has 11 columns of grids and 10 rows of grids. Thus, the international chess board for the Chinese chess is formed. The international chess board for the Chinese chess has a large space. The chess pieces are placed in the grids on the international chess board with more moving space and more diversified and complex playing methods for chess fans to select. The international chess board is more interesting and creative.",

Both the blue and gray are generally used by two persons and the number of the chess pieces is 48. The chessboard is provided with 48 chess positions with different names, and the chess positions are linearly connected by herringbone arrows or quadrilateral arrows. Blue or gray chess pieces at the tail of the arrow determine blue or gray chess pieces at the head of the arrow. The head and tail of the arrow are the same, and the head and tail of the quadrilateral are reverse. Two blue colors of two arrows are blue, one blue and one gray are gray; and two blue colors in three arrows are blue, and one blue color in three arrows is gray. One blue color in double-line herringbone arrows is blue; and the color at two ends of two lines is the same. In the process of playing chess, a person A playing able chess orderly arranges the chess pieces, and a person B playing the health detection chess transversely arranges the chess pieces. Each person has 24 chess pieces; the chess pieces are arranged at the chess positions by using proper colors according to the thinking and judgment of the persons; one chess piece is arranged each time; the persons A and B arrange the chess pieces in turn until all chess pieces are arranged. Right or wrong colors of the chess pieces are judged according to the rule; if wrong, ordered and transverse arranging directions of the chess pieces are corrected and changed, and the chess pieces are lost or gained.
